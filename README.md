# BO-for-AutoSTM
The program "B_SP_prediction_using_BO", originally authored by Dr. Arpan Biswas, is used for the control parameter prediction for STM. The function "parameter_prediction()" is used to predict the next aquisition point of the contol parameters: Bias (V) and Setpoint(pA)
The demonstrative routine is provided at the end of the program in "BO_on_STM_toy_model.ipynb", where the fft_peak is extracted from the original data while the control paramters (i.e., bias and setpoint) are estimated using the BO algorithm.
